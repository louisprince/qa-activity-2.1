# Work
- I work at CarFinance 247 as a 1st Line Support which can often be boring due to it's repetitive nature
- I try to find lots automation/configuration/deployment stuff to keep from getting bored
- To do that I write a lot of PowerShell and also build flows in Power Automate
- I want to move sideways into the dev team since it looks way more interesting

# Outside of work
- Outside of work I first learned to code in Java building Android apps (back before the Kotlin)

- To go along with Express APIs I've written lots of TypeScript building frontends using Angular
- Briefly looked at Svelte
